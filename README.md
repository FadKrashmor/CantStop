# CantStop
Analysis for the game "Can't Stop"
The game can be found on the website Board Game Arena.
This project is simply to familiarise myself with using GitHub.

At Rev 2, the program can calculate the probability of throwing one of up to three totals. A start has been made on code to analyse progress in the game.

Revision 3 will attempt a valuation of the progress made so far in the game.
